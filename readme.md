These are my solutions to the https://adventofcode.com/2021 puzzles.

### Packages

Only `pytest` if you want to run the unit tests.

### Execution

```commandline
cd day_X
python compute.py
```

Some days may have command line parameters, use `--help` to check.

Or the tests:
```commandline
cd day_X
pytest .
```
